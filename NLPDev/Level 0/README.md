# Level 0 - Convincing AI of a False Fact

## Task Overview

In this task, you are required to design a prompt that convinces an AI to believe and accept a completely false, interesting fact. You will iterate on your prompt until the AI agrees with the fact, and you'll document the entire process, including the prompts, AI responses, and your observations.

### Objective

- Convince the AI to accept a false fact through prompt engineering.
- Refine your prompts iteratively to improve their effectiveness.
- Document the entire process of interaction with the AI.

### Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repo**

   - Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repo**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local environment.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Hacktoberfest_2024
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**

   - Move into the Level 0 directory to work on your task:

   ```bash
   cd Hacktoberfest24/NLPDev/Level 0/
   ```

4. **Create a Folder with Your Username**

   - Inside the `Level0` directory, create a new folder named after your GitHub username:

   ```bash
   mkdir <your_username>
   ```

5. **Design and Test the Prompt**

   - Create a prompt that presents a false fact to the AI.
   - Interact with the AI by submitting the prompt.
   - Review the AI's response and refine your prompt iteratively.
   - Keep testing and refining until the AI accepts the false fact.

6. **Document the Process**

   - In a `.txt` or `.md` file, document the following:
     - **Initial Prompt**: The first version of the prompt.
     - **AI Response**: The AI's response to each version.
     - **Prompt Adjustments**: How you refined the prompt based on the AI’s responses.
     - **Iterations**: All versions of the prompt, with notes on changes.
     - **Conclusion**: A summary of how effective your final prompt was.

7. **Add the Documentation File**

   - Add your `.txt` or `.md` file documenting the entire process to your username's folder:

   ```bash
   cp <your_documentation>.md <your_username>/
   ```

8. **Add and Commit Your Changes**

   - After adding your files, stage the changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   - Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added Level 0 AI False Fact task by <your_username>"
   ```

9. **Push Your Changes and Open a Pull Request**

   - Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   - Open a Pull Request (PR) to submit your work for review.
