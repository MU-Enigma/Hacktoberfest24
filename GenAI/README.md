# GenAI Problem Types
Please refer to the corresponding folders for exact problem statements and instructions.

## Level 0
- Redesign the Enigma logo using any Generative AI tool (e.g., DALL·E, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion).
  
- Submissions in the form of images.

- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e., Level0) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following:
  + The AI-generated logo in `.png` or `.jpg` format.
  + A text file (`model_and_prompt.txt`) that includes:
    - The AI model/tool used.
    - The exact prompt used to generate the logo.

## Level 1
- Complete the provided image by generating the missing part using any Generative AI inpainting tool (e.g., DALL·E Inpainting, Stable Diffusion Inpainting).
  
- Submissions in the form of images.

- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e., Level1) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following:
  + The original image with the missing part.
  + The AI-generated completed image.
  + A text file (`model_and_prompt.txt`) that includes:
    - The AI model/tool used.
    - The exact prompt used to generate the missing part.

## Level 2
- Generate a spooky beat using any local Generative AI music tool (e.g., Magenta, RAVE). The beat should be generated locally without using cloud services.
  
- Submissions in the form of audio files.

- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e., Level2) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following:
  + The AI-generated beat in `.mp3` or `.wav` format.
  + A text file (`tools_and_process.txt`) that includes:
    - The tool/framework used (e.g., Magenta, RAVE).
    - The exact steps and parameters used to generate the beat.

## Level 3
- Generate poetry without using a Large Language Model (LLM). Implement the solution using techniques like Markov chains, grammar-based models, or any other non-LLM-based approach.
  
- Submissions in the form of text files.

- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e., Level3) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following:
  + The AI-generated poem in `.txt` format.
  + A text file (`methodology.txt`) that includes:
    - A description of the method used to generate the poetry.
    - The steps taken to build and run the model.
    - (Optional) Include code files if applicable to replicate the results.
