**More specific resources for each level can be found in the README.md files for the respective levels.**

## Level 0
- Model any two chess pieces in Blender, and design both black and white versions.
  
- Submissions in the form of images and blend files
  
- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e. Level1) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following
  + A screenshot of your model and its respective blend file, ensure that you include a blend file (you can model multiple pieces in the same blend file) with the screenshot.

## Level 1
- Build a simple game in Godot where pieces move according to their basic rules (e.g., pawns move forward, knights move in an L-shape).
- Focus on proper movement without worrying about capturing, castling, or special rules.
- Include the whole project folder along with a short video showcasing the movement that you implemented for each piece type. 
 
- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e. Level1) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following
  
  + All the files required to run your submission
    
  + The whole project folder (Click the folder icon under your project name in Godot main menu and upload the entire project folder)
  + A short video showcasing the movement that you implemented for each piece type.
  + If possible include screenshots of the exact code for the movement.

## Level 2
-  Implement capturing mechanics, along with checks and checkmates. There’s no need for stalemates, en passant, or castling—just focus on the core rules of the game.
  
- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e. Level2) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following
  
  + All the files required to run your submission
    
  + The whole project folder (Click the folder icon under your project name in Godot main menu and upload the entire project folder)
  + A short video showcasing the capturing (with different pieces in different situations).
  + A short video showcasing the checks and checkmates (with different pieces in different situations).
  + If possible include screenshots of the exact code for capturing, checks, and checkmates.

## Level 3
- Introduce your own unique twist—this could be special abilities for certain pieces, changing the board’s layout mid-game, etc.
    
- Within the folder corresponding to the Level (i.e. Level3) create a folder with the same name as your username and include in it the following
  
  + All the files required to run your submission
       
  + The whole project folder (Click the folder icon under your project name in Godot main menu and upload the entire project folder) 
  + A short video showcasing your unique twist (if possible explain the twist in your video, completely optional).
  + A [README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) file detailing you twist and how it works
  + If possible include screenshots of the exact code for the twist.
